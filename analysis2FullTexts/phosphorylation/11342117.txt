Abstract
Thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK, EC 2.7.6.2) catalyses phosphorylation of thiamin to thiamin pyrophosphate, an active enzyme cofactor. Here we describe the cloning of complete human TPK1 cDNA from an adult liver library. Human TPK1 is 89% identical to murine TPK1 at the protein level. The gene maps to chromosome 7q34–36, consists of at least eight exons, and spans a distance at least of 420 kb. The mRNA of human TPK1 is highly expressed in testis, small intestine and kidney with lesser but detectable expression in brain, liver, placenta and spleen. The availability of the human TPK1 gene will provide another useful tool for studying the role of this enzyme in human thiamin metabolism and deficiency state.

Thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK) catalyzes the conversion of thiamin to thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP), an active cofactor for transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, enzymes involved in glycolysis and energy production. This enzyme also serves as the driving force for thiamine accumulation within cells [1]. Dietary thiamin deficiency results in decreased activity in one or more of these TPP-dependent enzymes, resulting in diseases such as beriberi and Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome [2]. Mutations in the high-affinity thiamin transporter gene SLC9A2 that impair thiamine entry into cells lead to a syndrome of thiamin-responsive megaloblastic anemia [3], [4], [5] and [6]. Decreased activity of TPK, another mechanism for the depletion of intracellular TPP, is also associated with the thiamin-responsive anemia syndrome [7], [8] and [9], although the change is not the primary cause of this disorder. However, the human TPK (hTPK) gene has not been cloned and studies to relate the expression of this enzyme or possible mutations in this gene to thiamin deficiency have not been possible.

We generated a fragment of hTPK1 cDNA by RT–PCR with mRNA purified from human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells using two primers that were chosen based upon the homology between human and murine sequences [10]. These primers corresponded to sequences from nucleotide 52035 to 52016 of AC004833.1 and from nucleotide108917 to 108936 of AC004543.1. Screening of a human liver retroviral library (Clontech) using this fragment as a probe identified five clones containing either partial or entire coding sequences. The largest one comprises 2448 bp with 3' and 5' UTRs of 90 and 1629 bp, respectively (accession number AF297710). The presence of a polyadenine tail indicates that this cDNA has a complete 3' terminus. The completeness of the 5' terminus was confirmed separately by the 5'-RACE system (Life Technologies) using an antisense primer (520–539 of the hTPK1 cDNA) and mRNA from human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells. The ATG initiation codon conforms to Kozak rules with a guanine at both position +4 and -3 [11]. Two polyadenylation sites, AATAAA, were found at nucleotide positions 1367 and 2400. The open reading frame of hTPK1 cDNA was 86% identical to that of murine TPK1 (mTPK1), but there was no homology at all in 5' and 3' UTRs between the two genes. The predicted protein contained 243 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 27?263, consistent with a molecular mass of purified hTPK polypeptide from human red blood cells of 28 kDa [12]. hTPK1 was 89% identical and 94% similar to the murine protein. It was also 28% identical to THI80, TPK1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 38% identical to the C-terminal half of tnr3, TPK from Schizosaccharomyces pombe [13] and [14]. BLASTp searches also identified one protein (AAF54690) predicted from the Drosophila melanogaster genomic sequence and one protein (CAA77455) predicted from the Caenorhabditis elegans genomic sequence, with identities of 35 and 30%, respectively. Alignments of these protein sequences revealed identical amino acid residues and conserved regions across species which must play a critical role in enzyme function ( Fig. 1).

Predicted amino acid sequence of hTPK1 and CLUSTERW alignment with TPK1s from other species. hTPK1 was aligned with TPK1 from mouse (AB027568), TPK predicted from genomic sequences of Drosophila melanogaster (AAF54690) and Caenorhabditis elegans (CAA77455), and THI80 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (D14417). Identical residues are indicated by dark shading and similar residues are identified by light shading. Numbers on the left represent amino acid residue position.

BLASTn search revealed that the entire hTPK1 cDNA, with the exception of the first 133 bp, was sequenced as a part of Human Genomic Project by the University of Washington Genome Center. The gene maps to chromosome 7q34–36 within contig NT_001431 ( Fig. 2). GenBank components AC004743.1, AC004833.1, AC004861.1 and AC004543.1 contain exons 2–8 as indicated in Fig. 2. All exon–intron boundaries conform to consensus donor–acceptor sequences (gt/ag) for RNA splicing. The remaining 5' 133 bp fragment was not found in any completed human genomic sequences and probably exists as the first exon in a 90 kb gap between AC 004538.1 and AC 004543.1. Thus, the total hTPK1 gene spans a genomic distance of at least 420 kb and the largest exon (eight) is as large as 1.7 kb. Both features are atypical for a human gene.

Genomic localization of hTPK1 and organization relationship to hTPK1 cDNA. Contig and GenBank components are indicated by solid boxes. Exons are identified by numbered lines in the open box of the genomic fragment. The nucleotide positions of the start and stop codons, polyadenylation sites (in parentheses), and exon junctions in the cDNA are indicated. The first 133 bp of cDNA, not yet sequenced by the Human Genomic Project, locates most likely in the gap between AC004538.1 and AC004743.1. We arbitrarily named it exon 1, placed it in the middle of the gap, and labeled it with a question mark.

Northern analysis of a human multi-tissue blot hybridized with a partial hTPK1 cDNA ( Fig. 3) identified a transcript of ~2.6 kb, consistent with the size of the complete cDNA cloned. Another smaller transcript (1–1.5 kb) was only detected in testis. It remains to be determined if this message was derived by usage of polyadenylation site 1367. The steady-state message level was highest in testis, followed by kidney and small intestine. hTPK1 transcript was also clearly seen in brain, liver, placenta and spleen, but barely detectable in colon, heart, lung muscle and stomach when the blot was exposed to film for 3 days. The expression pattern of hTPK1 differs from that of mTPK1 mainly by the higher expression level in testis [10].

Expression of hTPK1 in various tissues. A human multi-tissue blot (Origene Technologies) was hybridized with 32P-labeled partial hTPK1 cDNA (nucleotides 217–825). The blot was exposed to BioMax MS film for 24 h at -80°C. The blot was then stripped, re-probed with a 32P-labeled human ß-actin and exposed to BioMax MS film for 0.5 h at room temperature. RNA markers are indicated on the left.

In summary, hTPK1 was highly homologous to mTPK1 at both nucleotide and protein levels. The gene was found to be huge and the message levels are high in those tissues involved in thiamin absorption (small intestine) and re-absorption (kidney).
