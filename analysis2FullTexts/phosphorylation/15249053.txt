Abstract
Pyridoxal kinase is an ATP dependent enzyme that phosphorylates pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine forming their respective 5'-phosphorylated esters. The kinase is a part of the salvage pathway for re-utilizing pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, which serves as a coenzyme for dozens of enzymes involved in amino acid and sugar metabolism. Clones of two pyridoxal kinases from Escherichia coli and one from human were inserted into a pET 22b plasmid and expressed in E. coli. All three enzymes were purified to near homogeneity and kinetic constants were determined for the three vitamin substrates. Previous studies had suggested that ZnATP was the preferred trinucleotide substrate, but our studies show that under physiological conditions MgATP is the preferred substrate. One of the two E. coli kinases has very low activity for pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine. We conclude that in vivo this kinase may have an alternate substrate involved in another metabolic pathway and that pyridoxal has only a poor secondary activity for this kinase.

Vitamin B6 is a key nutrient in all cells being converted to its coenzyme forms of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)1 and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP). PLP and to a lesser extent PMP serve as cofactors for dozens of enzymes that primarily involve amino acid and sugar metabolism. Many bacteria and plants can synthesize PLP de novo from small metabolites, but mammalian cells do not have the biosynthetic pathway and require one of the three vitamin forms, i.e., pyridoxine, pyridoxal, or pyridoxamine or their phosphorylated derivatives [1].

Both bacteria and eukaryotic cells have a group of enzymes to salvage vitamin B6 during protein turnover. These include pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase, pyridoxal kinase (PL kinase) (EC 2.7.1.35), and pyridoxine phosphate oxidase [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] and [9]. Structural and kinetic studies have been done on both Escherichia coli and mammalian pyridoxal phosphate oxidase [10] and [11]. Less information is available on the kinase that phosphorylates PL, PN, and PM. PL kinases have been purified and characterized from human, sheep, and pig brain, pig liver, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Trypanosoma brucei [6], [7], [8], [12], [13] and [14]. Recently, the structure of the sheep brain enzyme has been determined [15] and [16]. E. coli was shown to contain two different isozymes of pyridoxal kinase, but little has been done to characterize these two isozymes and no structural information is available [4] and [5].

In this report, we take clones of the cDNA for human and the two E. coli PL kinase genes and express, purify, and characterize the corresponding enzymes and determine their kinetic properties. Unlike previous studies that showed ZnATP to be the favored substrate for the human, sheep, and pig brain and E. coli kinases, we conclude that under physiological conditions MgATP is the favored substrate. We also show that one of the two E. coli kinases is kinetically slow compared to its counterpart and suggest the possibility that the true substrate for this enzyme is some other metabolite.

Experimental procedures
Materials
All substrates, buffers, and coenzymes were purchased from either Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburg, MA) and were of the highest purity available. Phenyl Sepharose was purchased from Sigma, ceramic hydroxyapatite was from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA), and Fractogel EMD TMAE was from Merck (Gibbstown, NJ). All culture media were obtained from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD). Cloned E. coli methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase was expressed from a pET22b(+) expression vector and purified from E. coli [17].

Preparation of clones of PL kinases
The E. coli PdxK gene (which codes for ePL kinase 1) (GenBank Accession No. U53700) was cloned into a pET22b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) expression vector as previously described [17]. The E. coli PdxY gene (which codes for ePL kinase 2) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using purified E. coli XL1-Blue genomic DNA as template and the following primers: 5'-CAGGGView the MathML sourceATGAAAAATATTCTCGCTATCC-3' and 5'-CCTCView the MathML sourceAGATATTTCAGAGCTTTGTTGCG-3'. Unique NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced by the primers. The 874-bp polymerase chain reaction fragment was purified, digested with NdeI and EcoRI, and ligated into a pET22b(+) vector (5493 bp) that had been linearized with the same restriction enzymes. The construct, designated as pET22-PdxY, was then used to transform E. coli HMS174(DE3)-competent cells for protein expression. The PdxY gene in the plasmid construct was fully sequenced and shown to be correctly amplified according to the sequence available from the NCBI database (Accession No. NC000913). The PdxY gene was also transferred from the pET22-PdxY construct into a pET28a(+) vector, using the same unique NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites. The new construct, designated as pET28-PdxY, was then used to transform E. coli HMS174(DE3)-competent cells for expression of the His-tagged protein. A 1011 bp cDNA fragment encoding human PL kinase, cloned into a pCDM8 vector, was a gift from Dr. Ewen Kirkness (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, Maryland) [7]. The human pyridoxal kinase cDNA was re-amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the pCDM8_PKHconstruct as template and the following primers: 5'-GGATCCAGGCCCView the MathML sourceGAGGAGGAGTGC-3' and 5'-GCTGCGTGTCACGView the MathML sourceCGGCGGGG-3'. Unique NdeI and AvaI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced by the primers. The 952-bp polymerase chain reaction fragment was purified, digested with NdeI and AvaI, and ligated into a pET22b(+) vector that had been linearized with the same restriction enzymes. The construct, designated as pET22-hPLK, was then used to transform E. coli HMS174(DE3)-competent cells for protein expression. The cDNA encoding for hPL kinase in the plasmid construct was fully sequenced and shown to be correctly amplified according to the sequence available from the NCBI database (Accession No. U89606).

Kinetic studies
All assays were performed at 37 °C in a 1 cm thermostated cuvet. Assays for enzyme activity during purification were performed by adding aliquots of enzyme solutions (5–200 µl) to a cuvet containing 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.1 (300–500 µl). ZnATP was added to 40 µM and the reaction was started by the addition of 1 mM PL. The increase in PLP absorbance at 388 nm (e=4900 M-1 cm-1, pH 7.0) was monitored for about 60 s in an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. The initial velocity was used to calculate enzyme units (1 µmol of product formed per minute). Protein concentration was determined in the presence of nucleic acids from the A260 nm:280 nm ratio according to Layne [18]. An absorbance of 1.0 at 280 nm was taken as a 1 mg/ml protein solution.

Km and kcat values for ATP and PL were determined from double reciprocal plots of variable substrate concentration versus initial velocity. Km values for PL were determined by varying its concentration between 5 and 100 µM at near saturating ATP levels of 2 mM. Km values for ATP were determined from double reciprocal plots varying its concentration from 50 µM to 1 mM with PL held constant at 1 mM (15 µg ePL kinase or 100 µg hPL kinase was used in each assay). Each data point was the average of at least two experiments with values differing by less than 10%. Each Km value was determined from a linear regression analysis of 5–6 data points with concentrations of the variable substrate bracketing the Km value. Values for kcat were determined from the y-axis intercept of the double reciprocal plots. The two values obtained for kcat with PL and ATP as variable substrates were normally within 10%. This similarity of the two values for kcat served as a control that the fixed substrate was near saturating level.

Determination of Km and kcat values for PN and PM was performed by converting the products of the kinase reaction, PNP and PMP, to PLP using human pyridoxal 5'-phosphate oxidase (hPNPOx) by a modification of a previously described procedure [19]. The PLP produced was then used to convert catalytically inactive apo-rabbit cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (rcSHMT) to active holo-rcSHMT and its activity was determined as previously described [19]. The following were added to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf vial: PL kinase (0.2 µg ePL kinase or 0.4 µg hPL kinase); MgATP (50–800 µM); PN or PM (5–150 µM); potassium phosphate, 20 mM, pH 7.3, with 2.5 mM of 2-mercaptoethanol to a final volume of 50 µl. After 5 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 µl of 0.5 M EDTA and by placing the reaction vial in a boiling water bath for 30 s. To this solution, the following were added: 60 µg apo-rcSHMT; 60 µg hPNPOx; and reaction buffer to a final volume of 200 µl. This solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to convert the PNP or PMP to PLP. After a brief centrifugation to clarify the solution, the reaction volume was placed in a spectrophotometer cuvet and NADP, tetrahydrofolate, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, and l-serine were added to determine the amount of holo-rcSHMT that had been formed [19]. The initial rate of ?A340 nm/min was determined for each solution and compared to a standard curve prepared by incubating under the same conditions known amounts of PLP with apo-rcSHMT. The relationship of ?A340 nm/min to PLP was linear over the range of 10–300 pmol.

Km and kcat values were determined from double reciprocal plots of initial rate of holo-rcSHMT versus the variable substrate concentration (at least a 10-fold range) with the co-substrate held constant at a concentration at least four times its Km value. As stated in the previous paragraph, each data point was the average of at least two determinations and the two values for kcat, determined from the plot of each variable substrate, were normally within 20% of each other. The values with ATP as the fixed substrate were always lower because it was not possible to achieve saturation.

Expression and purification of PL kinases
Each clone is grown in 300 ml of 1.5× LB broth, with 30 mg ampicillin, overnight at 37 °C. In the morning, the 300 ml of overnight culture is added to 5.7 L of 1.5× LB broth in a New Brunswick BioFlo 110 fermentor at 37 °C and incubated until the OD600 nm is about 1.5. A sterile solution of isopropyl-ß-d-thiogalactoside is added to 0.5 mM, the temperature is adjusted to 30 °C, and the incubation is continued for another 7 h. Cells are collected by centrifugation and stored overnight at 4 °C.

The next morning cells are suspended in 100 ml of 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and then ruptured by osmotic shock in an Avestin cell disrupter (Ottawa, Canada). A 10 ml solution of streptomycin sulfate (in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3) is added to a final concentration of 10 g/L. Ammonium sulfate is added to either 25% (144 g/L) (ePL kinase 1 and ePL kinase 2) or 30% (176 g/L) (human kinase) and the slurry is centrifuged at 10,000g for 25 min. The pellet is discarded and solid ammonium sulfate is added to 55% of saturation (193 g/L for the E. coli kinases) or 60% (162 g/L for the human kinase) and the solution is again centrifuged at 10,000g for 25 min. The resulting pellet is dissolved in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3. Human PL kinase is dialyzed overnight against two changes of 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3.

E. coli PL kinase 1 and PL kinase 2
The dissolved ammonium sulfate pellets for the two E. coli enzymes are added to separate 5.5 × 10 cm phenyl Sepharose columns equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.25, containing 20% ammonium sulfate (114 g/L). The columns are washed with equilibration buffer until the A260 nm is below 0.2. The material that does not bind to the column is mostly nucleic acids. The enzymes are then eluted with a linear gradient of 400 ml of equilibration buffer (A-buffer) and 400 ml of 20 mM sodium BES, pH 7.5 (buffer B). Each enzyme elutes at the end of the gradient and by the addition of 200 ml buffer B containing 5% propylene glycol. The fractions collected with activity are pooled and ammonium sulfate was added to 60% of saturation (390 g/L) and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000g for 20 min. The precipitate is dissolved in minimal 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and dialyzed overnight against two changes of this buffer.

The dialyzed enzymes are added to separate 5.5 × 10 cm columns of TMAE support equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3. The absorbed proteins are washed with equilibration buffer until A260 nm is below 0.2. Proteins are eluted by a linear gradient of 250 ml of equilibration buffer (buffer A) and 250 ml of equilibration buffer containing 200 mM NaCl (buffer B). About 8 ml fractions are collected. The enzymes elute mid-way through the gradient. An SDS–PAGE gel is run on every other fraction having an A278 nm over 0.5. Those fractions showing the greatest purity for each kinase (31 kDa in size) are pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate added to 60% of saturation (390 g/L). The precipitate is re-suspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and added to a second 3 × 18 cm phenyl Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, containing 20% ammonium sulfate (114 g/L). A linear gradient of 200 ml each of equilibration buffer and 20 mM sodium BES, pH 7.3 (buffer B), is then run through the column. The enzymes elute at the end of the gradient and by the addition of 200 ml buffer B containing 10% propylene glycol. An SDS–PAGE gel is run on every other fraction with an A278 nm over 0.4. Those fractions having the greatest purity are pooled and the enzyme is precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate to 60% of saturation (390 g/L). The protein pellet is dissolved in a minimal amount of 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and the solution is dialyzed against this buffer. The enzyme solutions are stored at -80 °C and are stable for at least weeks.

ePL kinase 2 with His tag
After cell rupture and the two ammonium sulfate precipitations described above, the enzyme solution is re-suspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and dialyzed extensively in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The dialyzed solution is then added to a 2 × 7 cm Ni–NTA column pre-equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The column is washed with more than 1 liter of the equilibration buffer until the A260 is below 0.2. The His-tagged enzyme is then eluted with a linear gradient of the equilibration buffer and the equilibration buffer with 50 mM imidazole (100 ml of each buffer). Additional equilibration buffer with 100 mM imidazole is added at the end of the gradient to completely elute all the protein. Fractions with A278 greater than 0.8 were combined and concentrated with 60% saturation of ammonium sulfate; the pellet is dissolved in 20 mM potassium phosphate and then dialyzed in 20 mM sodium BES, pH 7.3.

Human PL kinase
The dialyzed enzyme solution is loaded onto a 5 × 9 cm TMAE column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3. The column is washed until A260 is below 0.4. The enzyme is then eluted with a linear gradient of the equilibration buffer and 40 mM potassium phosphate, 0.2 M sodium chloride, pH 6.8 (400 ml of each buffer). Fractions with activity are pooled and concentrated with 60% ammonium sulfate. The pellet is then re-suspended in 20 mM potassium phosphate and immediately loaded onto a 2.5 × 6 cm phenyl Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, with 20% ammonium sulfate. The column is washed with the equilibration buffer until the A260 is less than 0.2. The enzyme is then eluted with a linear gradient of the equilibration buffer and 20 mM sodium BES, pH 7.3, with 5% propylene glycol (B-buffer) (100 ml each buffer). The enzyme is eluted near the end of the gradient and with an additional 100 ml of the B-buffer. Fractions with activity are pooled, concentrated with 60% ammonium sulfate, and dialyzed against two changes of 20 mM sodium BES, pH 7.3. The dialyzed sample is then loaded onto a 2 × 6 cm hydroxyapatite column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM sodium BES, pH 7.3. The enzyme is eluted with a linear gradient of 100 ml each of the equilibration buffer and 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3. Activity of the collected fractions is checked. An SDS–PAGE gel is loaded with every other fraction where the A278 was greater than 0.5 to verify purity. The purest fractions are combined and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation.

Determination of molar absorptivity coefficients
The predicted molar absorptivity coefficient for each kinase was determined from their amino acid composition according to the method of Gill and von Hippel [20]. The actual coefficients are determined by multiplying the predicted value by the ratio of absorbance at 278 nm in 8 M urea (denatured state) and 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3 (native state), for a dilute solution of the respective kinase.

Results and discussion
Purification
Each PL kinase is expressed to a level of 5–20% of soluble protein (Table 1). The predicted pI values from amino acid composition are 5.75, 5.14, and 6.05 and the molar absorptivity coefficients at 278 nm are 30,350, 28,850, and 27,910 M-1 cm-1 for hPL kinase, ePL kinase 1 and ePL kinase 2, respectively. The E. coli PL kinases do not bind to the anion exchanger TMAE until most of the nucleic acid has been removed by a phenyl Sepharose column. After the ammonium sulfate precipitation and a single column (either TMAE or phenyl Sepharose), the kinases are greater than 80% pure, but with several trace impurities. These are mostly removed by chromatography on a second and third column. However, a minor contaminant that exhibits a size of 80 kDa for the human kinase and 50 kDa for the E. coli enzymes persists and could not be removed by molecular sieve chromatography ( Fig. 1). However, these contaminants do not appear to hinder crystallization of each of the kinases (personal communication from Faik Musayev).

The purified ePL kinase 2 preparation shows about l% of the activity found with the ePL kinase 1 preparation. Since both kinases are purified by essentially the same procedure, we could not rule out that at least some of the low activity of the ePL kinase preparation is actually the result of wild-type ePL kinase 1 being present. To circumvent this problem we added a His tag to the ePL kinase 2 clone at the N-terminus and purified this expressed protein on a Ni–NTA column. ePL kinase 1 does not bind to the Ni–NTA column but the cloned His-tagged PL kinase 2 does bind, as verified by both activity and SDS–PAGE gels. Activity of the purified His-tagged enzyme with the substrates PL and PN is less than 0.7 and 0.02% of the purified ePL kinase 1 activity with the same respective substrates. The very low activity with PN is in agreement with previous studies that showed PN would not support growth of a mutant blocked in both the biosynthetic pathway and PL kinase 1 [5]. However, the 0.7% activity with PL as substrate is apparently enough to allow E. coli cells that are blocked in the biosynthetic pathway to grow [5].

The very low activity of ePL kinase 2 suggests that this kinase may be for another metabolic intermediate but can use PL as an alternate substrate so that it can support growth [5]. The activity is so low with ePL kinase 2 that we could not determine if the low activity was the result of a high Km value, low kcat value or a combination of both.

Kinetic constants
Table 2 summarizes the apparent Km and kcat values for the enzymes purified as described above determined using saturating concentrations of the co-substrates. Km values for all substrates are similar or lower for the human form of the enzyme compared to ePL kinase 1. This also was true for kcat values where the human kinase value is 2–10-fold lower with the substrates PL, PN, and PM compared to the values for ePL kinase 1. As noted above, the catalytic activity for ePL kinase 2 is very low and Km and kcat values were not determined.

We could find only a single previous study for kinetic constants for E. coli PL kinase [21]. The largest difference between our values and those reported earlier is with PM as substrate, where White and Dempsey reported a value for Km as 500 µM (ZnATP as cosubstrate) as opposed to our values of 30 µM with MgATP and 10 µM with ZnATP ( Table 2). This difference is most likely not the result of pH differences since the earlier study was done at pH 7.0, compared to our study at pH 7.3. We did observe, however, inhibition by ZnATP when its concentration was above 100 µM, which may account for the different values.

The reported affinity of mammalian enzymes for PL, PN, and PM determined by previous studies varies widely [8], [22], [23] and [24]. They range for PL from 0.33 µM for the human enzyme to 150 and 500 µM for the rat and pig liver enzymes. However, all of these values were determined at pH values between 6.0 and 6.5 with Zn(II) as the divalent metal ion. Our values of 20–35 µM for all three substrates were determined at pH 7.3 with MgATP as cosubstrate (Table 2). We could find no previous Km values for MgATP, which we found to be in the 200–400 µM range for the human kinase with the three substrates and approximately 600 µM for all substrates with ePL kinase 1 ( Table 2).

In a previous study, the levels of B6 vitamers in E. coli cells were determined [19]. In that report, no detectable levels of PN and PM were found in E. coli cells, but PL levels were about 12 µM with about a third of this being free and two-thirds being protein bound. These results, combined with our kinetic studies, suggest that PL is the major substrate for ePL kinase 1 in the salvage pathway.

We also tested PLP as a product inhibitor of PL kinase for both the human and E. coli enzymes. Even at a concentration of 1 mM there was only about 15% inhibition. This amount of PLP far exceeds the non-protein bound level in E. coli cells and suggests that product inhibition is not an important control mechanism in the salvage pathway. Others have also shown that PLP is a very poor inhibitor of PL kinase [21] and [22].

pH sensitivity
Fig. 2 shows how the kcat and Km values for PL and ePL kinase 1 vary with pH. Only the Km value for MgATP shows significant variation with pH, dropping about 4-fold between pH 6.1 and 7.3. This results in about a 2-fold increase in the kcat/Km value between pH 6.1 and 7.3.

Zinc as the divalent metal ion
Previous studies concluded that Zn(II) is a better divalent metal ion than Mg(II) [21] and [22]. There was no evidence that Zn(II) was functioning as an activator, but rather that ZnATP was a more effective substrate than MgATP. We can find no evidence that ZnATP exists at any appreciable concentration in cells and conclude that the true substrate for PL kinases is MgATP. The reason for concluding that ZnATP is the preferred substrate results from the use of less than saturating concentrations of ATP and PL. As shown in Table 2 for ePL kinase 1, at pH 7.3, the Km value for ZnATP is 8.5-fold lower than MgATP, while the kcat values are almost the same. Therefore, the kcat/Km value for ZnATP is 7.5 times larger than the value for MgATP. The initial studies on E. coli PL kinase were performed with ATP levels at 100 µM, which is considerably below the Km value of 600 µM for MgATP, but above the Km value of 70 µM for ZnATP (or 45 µM for PM) ( Table 2).

With hPL kinase we found that ZnATP was a better substrate than MgATP at pH 6.1 if the concentrations of Zn(II) and Mg(II) were held below 40 µM (ATP also at 40 µM). Above 40 µM Zn(II) became inhibitory at both pH 6.1 and 7.3 (data not shown). This inhibitory property of Zn(II) was also observed with the rat liver enzyme and suggests that this will be a common property of mammalian PL kinases [22]. The early studies with rat PL kinase were performed with 10 µM ZnATP and when compared to MgATP gave a several-fold increased catalytic rate. However, when ZnATP and MgATP were used at 100 µM their catalytic rates were similar [22]. We conclude that even for the mammalian enzymes ZnATP appears to be a better substrate only when the metal nucleotide concentrations are low. Under physiological conditions MgATP will be the favored substrate.
